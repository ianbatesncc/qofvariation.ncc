 * separate into
  * extract (get into R objects)

  * process (subtotals, measures, compare)

 * use data-raw and data mechanisms
 * avoid use of taskdir and use devtools::package_file() equivalent

1.0

Basic calculations

 * load raw qof data
 * grouping by ccgs
 * calculate meausures - prevalence and indicators
 * compare - benchmark and spc

1.1

Include modelled disease prevalence

  - CCG level
  - observed Vs expected

1.2

Track practices over time

 - Introduce a 'practice_reporting_code' field

2.0

Basic Dashboard - Minimal

 * Rushcliffe CCG
 * heatmap of variation (SPC, benchmark)
 * stacked 100% barcharts of variation (indicator_code, CCG, GP)
    * treated (Gre), suboptimal (Ora), excepted (Red), excluded (Blu)

Future

 * dynamic choice of CCG
 * View QOF indicator metadata
 - Summary of variation (CCG)
