92659,Estimated prevalence of diagnosed hypertension (16+),Modelled estimate of the prevalence of diagnosed hypertension,"The estimated prevalence of high blood pressure as estimated by a predictive model developed by Imperial College, London. The full details of the model are available  https://github.com/julianflowers/prevalence_estimates/blob/master/Hypertension-model-2016-Technical-Document-v2.5.docx .The primary data source is the Health Survey for England, 2013 & 2014 pooled data. Hypertension in the Health Survegy for England is defined as systolic blood pressure ≥140 or diastolic blood pressure ≥90, according to commonly used standards. This modelling exercise developed two prevalence estimates:

Diagnosed hypertension, was derived from the number of patients that reported being told by a nurse or doctor that they had high BP.
Undiagnosed hypertension, was derived from those patients that, first, were considered uncontrolled or untreated hypertensive and second, they did not report having been diagnosed high blood pressure.","Hypertension is a major risk factor for kidney disease, heart disease and stroke and a public health priority for PHE and the wider public health system. It can be prevented by improving lifestyle by reducing alcohol and salt consumption, maintaining healthy weight and increasing physical activity. Hypertension is mainly detected and managed in general practice.According to the 2015 Global of Burden of Disease (GBD) study, high systolic blood pressure ranks second amongst risk factors for overall Disabilty Adjusted Life Years (DALYs).

The actual question is: “Did a doctor, psychiatrist or other professional tell you that you had the following condition: Depression?” No time restriction was put on the definition, so the diagnosis may have been made years ago and the disease will in many cases have resolved. The second outcome, undiagnosed depression, was derived from those respondents that reported they considered they experienced depression (variable DiagCX7), but were not diagnosed by a health professional. The actual question is: “Do you think that you have ever experienced any of these? Depression”. There is also a question: “In the last 12 months have you had: Depression?” which could be used to investigate annual incidence/point prevalence.",Major depression ranks 9th in the Global Burden of Disease as a major cause of morbidity.,,Health Survey for England 2014,Imperial College,,Logistic regression to create underlying model applied to local populations using inverse probability weighting,,Model based confidence intervals,"Estimates of disease counts are based on a logistic regression model developed by Imperial College based on the Health Survey for England 2014.Predictor variables in the final model are:
